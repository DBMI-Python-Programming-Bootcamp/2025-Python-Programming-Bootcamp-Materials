# 2025 Summer Python Programming Bootcamp - Assignment 02

### Due Tuesday, July 17 at 3:00pm

Part 0 : Setup
=====

* In PyCharm, create a Python script named "assignment02.py". 
* Write all of your Python code for the below tasks in the *assignment02.py* file.

Part 1 : Python lists and loops
======

Add Python code to do each of the following.
## Double Each Element

Create a list of numbers `mylist`, then write code to create a new list `mylist_doubled` with every number doubled. Then print the list.

Given: 
```python
mylist = [1, 4, 15, 5]
```

Should output:
```
[2, 8, 30, 10]
```

## Repeat a List

Write a program that repeats the values in a list `n` times.

For example:
```python
n = 3
mylist = [1, 2]
```

Should output:

```
[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

## Element-wise Addition
Given two lists of the same length, add their corresponding elements into a new list and print it out.

For example: 
```python
mylist_1 = [1, 2, 3]
mylist_2 = [4, 5, 6]
```

Should output:

```
[5, 7, 9]
```

## Print a pattern
Print a pattern `n` times

For example:
```python
n = 5
```

Should output:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```
## Grow a list and print a pattern
Print a pattern `n` times.

For example:
```python
n = 4
```

Should output:
```
[1],
[1, 2],
[1, 2, 3],
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Part 2 : Submission
