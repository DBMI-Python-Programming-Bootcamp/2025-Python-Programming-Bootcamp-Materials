2025 Summer Python Programming Bootcamp - Assignment 00
========
DUE Thursday, July 10 @ 3:00 PM Central
----------------------------


Introduction
============
For this assignment you will create a simple Python script and submit it to your Bootcamp-Assignments Box folder.


Part 1 : Box
======
* Log into Box.com in your web browser and verify that you can access the shared folder we created for you.


Part 2 : PyCharm
======
* Open PyCharm on your computer. If you do not yet have a PyCharm project set up, create one. If you already have a project folder for this bootcamp, you may continue to use that.
* Create a new python script named 'assignment00.py'


Part 3 : Write a simple program
======
* Write a simple program that does the following:
 - Create a variable called *fname* and assign it to your first name represented as a string literal
 - Create a variable called *lname* with your last name
 - Create a variable called *start\_year* with the year you joined UAMS represented as a numeric value
 - Using the *print* function, generate output that displays your name and the number of years you have been affiliated with UAMS

Here's an example:

```
fname = "Jonathan"
lname = "Bona"
start_year = 2016
```

Note that the first two variables use strings and the third one uses a number (Python will decide this is an *int*).

Below is an example showing what an assigment00 solution might "print" as output. 

```
Jonathan Bona joined UAMS in 2016, which means he's been here for 8 years
```

This line of output can be generated using a single print statement, which is left as an exercise for the reader.
This is probably the one tricky part of this assignment.


Part 3 : Submission
======
* Locate your *assignment00.py* file on your comptuer outside of PyCharm (Windows Explorer or Mac Finder)
* Log into Box.com and drag this file into your Bootcamp-Assignments folder
