2025 Summer Python Programming Bootcamp - Assignment 01
========

### Due Tuesday, July 15 at 3:00pm


Part 0: Setup
======
* In PyCharm, create a Python script named "assignment01.py". 

Write all of your Python code for the below steps in the *assignment01.py* file.
You will add Python code to this file within PyCharm and, when you are done, submit the file to Box, as described below. 
Make sure to try running your code as you work your way through these.


Part 1 : Python variables and basics
======


* Add Python code to "assignment01.py" that does the following:

  * Create variables named _givenName_ and _familyName_ and assign them values so that they store your given name and family name respectively (hint: these values should be python strings).

  * Create a variable named _startYear_ and assign it a value so that it stores the year you first became affiliated with UAMS (hint: year numbers like 2021 and 1980 as ints in Python, so don't accidentally make them into strings).

  * Add a _print_ statement that prints out a message reporting your full name, the year you started at UAMS, and how many years ago that was.

      * As an example, Dr. Bona's submission for this part of the exercise might print out the message: _Jonathan Bona joined UAMS in 2016, which was 9 years ago._

  * Add a _print_ statement that prints out the total length of your name.

      * As an example, Dr. Bona's submission for this part of the exercise might print out the message: _Jonathan Bona's name has length: 12_






Part 2 : Python list basics
======

  * Create a variable named _courses_ and assign it a list of strings that represent the names of the courses you are taking this fall. If you are not taking any courses or don't know yet what courses you'll be taking, just make up at least three examples (_Underwater Basketweaving_, _Informatics Approaches to TV Sitcom Analysis_, etc). Just for fun, make sure the course names are not in alphabetical order.

  * Add a _print_ statement that outputs a message with this full list of courses.

  * Add a _print_ statement that outputs a message with the name of just the first course in the list.

  * Add a _print_ statement that outputs a message with the name just the last course in the list.

  * Add a _print_ statement that outputs a message saying how many courses are in the list.

  * Add a _print_ statement that uses the Python function _sorted_ on your list and outputs the result.

      * For example, if your list is named _courses_ (as it should be), then you would add the following as a line in your Python file: _print(sorted(courses))_

  * Add a comment that explains what you think the _sorted_ function is doing to your list (hint: try running the above line before reporting what it does)





Part 3 : Submission
======
To submit this assignment, locate *assignment01.py* on your computer, and drag it into your submissions folder on Box.
